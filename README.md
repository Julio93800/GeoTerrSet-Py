# GeoTerrSet-Py

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to using **TerrSet** with **Python**. The goal is to explore different functionalities of TerrSet while automating geospatial analysis with Python scripts.

## Structure
The project is divided into a daily workflow, where each day focuses on a specific feature or automation task with TerrSet.

```
ðŸ“‚ GeoTerrSet-Py
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Day1_Setup            # Installing and configuring TerrSet for Python, includes Conda environment
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Day2_RasterAnalysis   # Working with raster data in TerrSet
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Day3_VectorProcessing # Handling vector data with Python
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Day4_ModelAutomation  # Automating workflows using Python scripts
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Day5_MachineLearning  # Exploring ML capabilities within TerrSet
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Resources             # Additional guides, datasets, and references
 â””â”€â”€ README.md                # This file
```

## Installation
Before running the scripts, ensure you have **TerrSet** installed along with Python. The project uses a **Conda environment with Python 3.10**. To set up the environment, navigate to `Day1_Setup` and run:

```bash
conda env create -f Day1_Setup/geoterrser-py_env.yml
conda activate geoterrset
```



## Getting Started
Each day's folder contains Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks explaining the functionality. Simply navigate to the desired day and run the scripts.

Example:
```bash
cd Day1_Setup
python setup_terrset.py
```
