# GeoTerrSet-Py

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to using **TerrSet** with **Python**. The goal is to explore different functionalities of TerrSet while automating geospatial analysis with Python scripts.

## Structure
The project is divided into a daily workflow, where each day focuses on a specific feature or automation task with TerrSet.

```
ðŸ“‚ TerrSet-Py
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Day1_Setup            # Installing and configuring TerrSet for Python
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Day2_RasterAnalysis   # Working with raster data in TerrSet
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Day3_VectorProcessing # Handling vector data with Python
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Day4_ModelAutomation  # Automating workflows using Python scripts
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Day5_MachineLearning  # Exploring ML capabilities within TerrSet
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Resources             # Additional guides, datasets, and references
 â””â”€â”€ README.md                # This file
```

## Installation
Before running the scripts, ensure you have **TerrSet** installed along with Python. You may also need additional libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas geopandas rasterio
```

## Getting Started
Each day's folder contains Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks explaining the functionality. Simply navigate to the desired day and run the scripts.

Example:
```bash
cd Day1_Setup
python setup_terrset.py
```
